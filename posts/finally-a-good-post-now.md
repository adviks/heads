The Latin phrase **memento mori** means "remember that you must die." It’s one of my favorite maxims. But, why should we even remember the death? Isn’t it so scary and depressing?

Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius said, "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. " I think it has a very important message. Death is not to be taken in a depressing and nihilistic way, but rather in a meaningful way.

Death means our time could be up at any time in this world.  The paucity of time should bring urgency to our life. Death should serve as a reminder to be more present at the moment, to be more meaningful in our actions.

The thought that this could be the last time I write makes this writing experience more meaningful. Whenever I meet someone, that could be the last time I ever meet that person. This thought makes my time with that person more meaningful.

Let death not scare you, but rather serve as a reminder to be more purposeful with your life.
